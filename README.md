# Mediasummon
## Summon your photos and videos back to you

Mediasummon is an open source application that fetches a copy of all your
photos and videos, and keeps them continuously backed up into one organized
directory either on your computer or on a cloud storage provider.

It can connect to several online media servicesâ€”like Google Photos, Instagram,
and Facebook Photos. Once you have authorized it to do so, Mediasummon will
periodically connect to each service and download any new photos or videos you
have uploaded.

You can store the downloaded files in a directory on your computer, or you can
have Mediasummon synchronize the files to a directory on a cloud storage
provider like Dropbox, Google Drive, or Amazon's S3. You don't have to
pick one, you can synchronize to several of these at once. Give it a shot!

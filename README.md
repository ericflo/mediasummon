# Mediasummon
## Summon your photos and videos back to you

Mediasummon fetches a copy of every photo and video that you upload to online
services, organizes those files by date, and keeps it continuously updated as
you go about your life.

It can connect to several services, like Google Photos, Instagram, and Facebook
Photos. Once you have authorized it to do so, Mediasummon will periodically
connect to each service and download any new photos or videos you have uploaded.

You can store the downloaded files in a directory on your computer, or you can
have Mediasummon synchronize the files to a directory on a cloud storage
provider like Dropbox, Google Drive, or even Amazon's S3. You don't have to
pick one, you can synchronize to several of these at once. Give it a shot!
